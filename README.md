# pyBSM

This is a placeholder for a potential future release of pyBSM. For now this repo can be used on imports internally to JATIC repos.

This repo builds off of the work done by LeMaster and Eismann in creating an original package for modeling image systems [[1]](#1) as well as LeMaster, et al in their work in validating the orginal pybsm package [[2]](#2).
